# Project-S2

## Overview

### What is this app for?
This app is for a code academy project.   
 

### What does it do?
It will demonstrate the use of both frontend and backend technologies.
 

### How does it work
The app uses flask to retrieve information from a mongoDB database and display that information using D3.js, DC.js and Crossfilter.js.  
This allows app data to be filtered and interactive. 

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - **Python** is a hugely popular general-purpose, high-level programming language, used in web and 
    game development and scientific projects.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
  - **PyCharm** is a professional Integrated Development Environment (IDE) made by JetBrains, 
    specifically for using with Python. It offers several features that are not available in other, 
    simpler editors like IDLE. 
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
  - **Bower** can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesnâ€™t 
    concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and
    their dependencies.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  - **Bootstrap** is a open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It
    contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface 
    components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com)
  - **Jquery** is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like 
    HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an
    easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - **MongoDB** is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model.
    Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, MongoDB is built on an architecture of 
    collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of key-value pairs and are the basic unit of data
    in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function as the equivalent of relational 
    database tables. 
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
  - **Flask** is a web framework which allows you to create a website to display pages, save data,
    and many other things. More accurately, it is a micro-framework, because it is a small program which 
    glues together other modules. 
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
  - **D3.js** is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using 
    HTML, SVG, and CSS. 
- [DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
  - **DC.js** is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient 
    exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts 
    in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant 
    feedback to user interaction.
- [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/)
  - **Crossfilter** is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. 
    Crossfilter supports extremely fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing a 
    million or more records; we built it to power analytics for Square Register, allowing merchants to slice and dice 
    their payment history fluidly.
- [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
  - **Font Awesome** is a full suite of pictographic icons that can be easily customised for websites.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - **Heroku** is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications 
    entirely in the cloud.
    
## Testing
 
**Functionality:**
- Checked all the links worked on all pages.
- Tested forms on all pages.
- Validated HTML/CSS using W3C.
- Checked all queries were executing correctly from database.
- Made sure there was compatibility with different browser platforms. This project was
  tested on; Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and MS Edge.
- Tested responsiveness and compatibility on mobile devices, IOS and Android.

## What was kept
 
- Flask py file - This was kept and modified as needed.
- CSV file - Upload this file to my database unchanged. This file can 
  be downloaded from [donorschoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org).
- graph.js - This file was modified in order to link to my flask py file.
- These files were kept and unchanged: Crossfilter.js, d3.js, dc.js, intro.js, jquery.min.js,
  keen.min.js, queue.js, dc.css, and introjs.cs.
  
## Deployment

- This project was uploaded and deployed on Heroku.
